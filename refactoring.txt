The codebase has been refactored in the following places:

1. In IndividualProjectApplication.java, a ConfigurableApplicationContext object was created that holds a reference to the currently running SpringBoot Application. This is used to terminate the application after completion of the integration tests, via the newly added stop application method.

2. Added a getter method for enrolledStudentCount in Course.java to aid in unit testing.

3. Added a method to duplicate (deep copy) a MyFileDatabase reference in MyFileDatabase.java, to ensure a fresh copy of data is available before each integration test, thus making them independent.
